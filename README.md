# CPU-Simulator
A CPU simulator in Java - The final project for CS 140 Programming with Objects and Data Structures at Binghamton University

The simulator can assemble files of its own mock assembly language into executable files, then run said files while showning the instructions being followed and the state of the simulated memory.
